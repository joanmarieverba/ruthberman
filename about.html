                </h2>
                <p>I write speculative fiction, poems (often on sf themes), and occasionally articles (usually on sf themes). When I was in
                high school, having read about sf fandom and fanzines in Anthony Boucher's <em>Rocket to the Morgue</em>, I informed my classmates
                Eleanor Arnason (who also became a fiction writer and poet) and Ron Whyte (who became a playwright) that as we were sf fans,
                we also should be putting out a fanzine. So we did, undaunted by the fact that we didn't know any other fans and hadn't seen
                any other fanzines. Finding out a couple of years later where Worldcons were, I started congoing, and so got in touch with
                other fans and other fanzines. When I graduated college, I looked at what I'd been writing, and saw that the fiction was
                uniformly bad, but the poems were fairly good and getting better. So I concentrated on poetry and for a couple of years gave
                up entirely trying to write fiction. But then <em>Star Trek</em> came along, and I couldn't help making up stories about the characters,
                and felt compelled to try writing some of them down. One of them, in turn, seemed worth trying to re-write as a story without
                the <em>Star Trek</em> elements (for instance, the starship became an airplane), and it probably became my first sale, "Ptolemaic
                Hijack," in <em>Worlds of Fantasy</em>, in 1971. ("Probably" because they neglected to say it had been accepted, and I heard sooner
                from a literary magazine, <em>Four Quarters</em>, that they were accepting "The Statement of Mrs. Thaddeus Usheen to the Press upon
                Being Rescued by the Coast Guard" but the published copy of "Mrs. Usheen" arrived a little later than the published copy of
                the "Hijack.") And I started getting poems accepted the same year, too. Since then, I've continued to write professionally,
                as well as a certain amount of fannish writing. The bibliography here deals with my professional work.

                <p><strong>Ruth Berman </strong>was conceived in Texas, born in Kentucky, and resident in Minnesota most of the rest of the time. As
                a middle child in a family that went in for reading aloud, she grew up hearing and speaking a wide variety of books, such
                as Mother Goose, Shakespeare, Lewis Carroll, L. Frank Baum, Louisa May Alcott, or Christopher Morley. Her work has appeared
                in
                <em>The Saturday Review, Amazing, Asimov's SF, Weird Tales, The Poet Dreaming in the Artist's House, Burning with a Vision, Aliens
                    and Lovers, The Tolkien Scrapbook, New Worlds, Shadows, Mathenauts, Xanadu</em>, and many other magazines and anthologies.
                Her book,
                <em>Dear Poppa: The World War II Berman Family Letters</em> (Minnesota Historical Society Press, 1997), was nominated for a Minnesota
                Book Award. [Biography from <em>Autumn World </em>]
