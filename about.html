                    <span class="text-green">the Author</span>
                </h2>
                <p>I write speculative fiction, poems (often on sf themes), and occasionally articles (usually on sf themes). When I was in
                high school, having read about sf fandom and fanzines in Anthony Boucher's <em>Rocket to the Morgue</em>, I informed my classmates
                Eleanor Arnason (who also became a fiction writer and poet) and Ron Whyte (who became a playwright) that as we were sf fans,
                we also should be putting out a fanzine. So we did, undaunted by the fact that we didn't know any other fans and hadn't seen
                any other fanzines. Finding out a couple of years later where Worldcons were, I started congoing, and so got in touch with
                other fans and other fanzines. When I graduated college, I looked at what I'd been writing, and saw that the fiction was
                uniformly bad, but the poems were fairly good and getting better. So I concentrated on poetry and for a couple of years gave
                up entirely trying to write fiction. But then <em>Star Trek</em> came along, and I couldn't help making up stories about the characters,
                and felt compelled to try writing some of them down. One of them, in turn, seemed worth trying to re-write as a story without
                the <em>Star Trek</em> elements (for instance, the starship became an airplane), and it probably became my first sale, "Ptolemaic
                Hijack," in <em>Worlds of Fantasy</em>, in 1971. ("Probably" because they neglected to say it had been accepted, and I heard sooner
                from a literary magazine, <em>Four Quarters</em>, that they were accepting "The Statement of Mrs. Thaddeus Usheen to the Press upon
                Being Rescued by the Coast Guard" but the published copy of "Mrs. Usheen" arrived a little later than the published copy of
                the "Hijack.") And I started getting poems accepted the same year, too. Since then, I've continued to write professionally,
                as well as a certain amount of fannish writing. 
                 Over the years, in addition to writing a lot of fanzine work on sf and fantasy generally, and stuff dealing with <em>Star Trek</em>,
                I’ve written stuff focused on the Land of Oz, Sherlock Holmes, Lewis Carroll, Tolkien’s Middle Earth, <em>Doctor Who</em>, and <em>Blake’s
                Seven</em> fandoms. Academically, I received a Ph.D. from the University of Minnesota with my dissertation, <em>Suspending Disbelief:
                the development of fantasy as a literary genre in nineteenth-century British fiction as represented by four leading periodicals,
                Edinburgh Review, Blackwood’s, Fraser’s, and Cornhill</em> (1979).
                
                The bibliography here deals with my professional work.

                <p><strong>Ruth Berman </strong>was conceived in Texas, born in Kentucky, and resident in Minnesota most of the rest of the time. As
                a middle child in a family that went in for reading aloud, she grew up hearing and speaking a wide variety of books, such
                as Mother Goose, Shakespeare, Lewis Carroll, L. Frank Baum, Louisa May Alcott, or Christopher Morley. Her work has appeared
                in
                <em>The Saturday Review, Amazing, Asimov's SF, Weird Tales, The Poet Dreaming in the Artist's House, Burning with a Vision, Aliens
                    and Lovers, The Tolkien Scrapbook, New Worlds, Shadows, Mathenauts, Xanadu</em>, and many other magazines and anthologies.
                Her book,
                <em>Dear Poppa: The World War II Berman Family Letters</em> (Minnesota Historical Society Press, 1997), was nominated for a Minnesota
                Book Award. [Biography from <em>Autumn World </em>]

            <strong>Ruth Berman</strong> blends a fan's enthusiasm with a scholar's learning. As a fan she was a founding member of the Minnesota Science
            Fiction Society, contributor of hundreds of letters to little magazines devoted to science fiction (SF) and fantasy (called
            "fanzines"), and editor of the outstanding <em>Star Trek</em> fanzine <em>T-Negative</em>, the general interest 'zine, <em>No</em>, and co-edited (with Ken Nahigian) <a href="https://fanlore.org/wiki/The_Middle-earth_Songbook"><em>The Middle-earth
            Songbook</em></a> (1975, American River College SF and Fantasy Society). She has also been active in the International Wizard of Oz Club, the Mythopoeic Society, the Tolkien Society of
            America, the Society for Creative Anachronism, and The Fantasy Association (to name a few). Ruth's formal study of English
            literature culminated in a Ph.D. dissertation at the University of Minnesota in 1979: <em>Suspending Disbelief: The Development
            of Fantasy as a Literary Genre in Nineteenth-Century Fiction</em>. She has taught freshman English at the Universities of Minnesota
            and Oklahoma. </p><p>Ruth's emergence as a fiction writer was recognized in the early seventies when she was guest of honor at Minicon,
            the annual Minnesota SF convention, and when she was a nominee for the annual John W. Campbell award for best new SF writer.
            She has published a couple of dozen short stories, at least three times as many poems, and many critical articles and reviews
            related to fantasy. She has served as Poetry Editor for both <em>Mythlore</em> and <em>Pandora</em>. Recently, Ruth has been translating fantasy
            stories from French originals. </p>
            <p>When Ruth helped start the Rivendell Discussion Group of the Mythopoeic Society in 1974, I
            soon became the chief organizer of the monthly meetings, and editor of the newsletter, but there was never any question that
            Ruth was naturally first among equals in our discussions of fantasy literature in the traditions of T.H. White, Ursula K.
            Le Guin and C.S. Lewis. Her wide reading, and graduate training, along with her intelligence and taste made her an authority
            to whom we would inevitably turn for an explanation of the literary background of some text under discussion, or of some
            doubtful passage, or for suggestions for further reading. Even during the two years that she taught English at the University
            of Oklahoma, scarcely a meeting would pass here in Minneapolis without someone observing, apropos some literary mystery,
            "Well, Ruth would know...."</p>
            <p> In December of 1976 I heard Ruth read a short story, "The Death of Gawaine," that struck me like
            a thunderclap. It remains one of my favorite stories. Although seeming too impossibly brief, it captures and portrays the
            reconciliation of a dying Gawaine with fate, and the refusal of his wife, a fairy princess out of medieval legend, to be
            reconciled with that fate, at least without protest. It is like many of Ruth's stories, short on action, yet economically
            and subtly capturing nuances of feeling and thought and meaning that are never spelled out by the narrator, but implicit
            in the way that characters find their own truths and persist in their integrity without.being understood by most other characters.
            That sort of quiet integrity is common to both the stories and the writer. </p>
            <p>This story also suggested a whole new approach
            to Arthurian legend, another world lurking beneath the obvious surface narratives of Malory or Chretien de Troyes, that of
            the women of the stories. This idea has since been employed by other writers, notably the bestselling Marion Zimmer Bradley,
            but none has been more hauntingly suggestive than Ruth's brief glimpse into a fey and almost feminist Faerie world. Characteristically,
            Ruth's story was inspired by reading and mulling over a 14th century legend. Even her creative writing is often inspired
            by her scholarly pursuits. </p>
            <p>In 1974, Ruth co-founded a writers' support group with Eleanor Arnason and Ellen Kuhfeld. This group
            has fostered numerous stories, poems, essays and critical articles. P.C. Hodgell has acknowledged its support in writing
            her well-received novels, and I believe that Mary Monica Pulver has also read some of her novels-in-progress to the group.
            I remember attending in the mid-'70s and hearing Pat read from an exciting narrative that would later appear in <em>God Stalk</em>
            (1982) and <em>Dark of the Moon</em> (1985). Hearing Ruth and Eleanor offer suggestions, and hearing them read and listen to criticism,
            I was reminded of other official and unofficial groups of likeminded writers (like the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood) throughout
            literary history. Or perhaps even the ancient guilds or brotherhoods of bards, or druids, priests or poets. Quietly, without
            ostentation, Ruth Berman embodies that history today, creating living and beautiful pasts and futures, for our present. [From David
